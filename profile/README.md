**Professional-grade DevOps SaaS tools — built from scratch, production-ready, and open for learning.**

Welcome to **Infrabukiks**, a platform dedicated to creating scalable, real-world DevOps SaaS projects. This organization serves as a launchpad for professional-grade tools designed, built, and deployed following **industry best practices** and the **12-Factor App methodology**.

## 🚀 What is Infrabukiks?

Infrabukiks is a DevOps-focused startup project with a simple goal:  
**Build, deploy, and operate SaaS tools the way modern engineering teams do.**

Every project in this org is:  

- 🌱 **Built from scratch** — no scaffolds, no shortcuts.  
- 🔥 **Production-ready** — using Docker, Terraform, CI/CD, monitoring, and zero-trust security.  
- 📖 **Documented** — so others can follow and learn.  
- 🧑‍💻 **Open for contributions** (soon).  

This is not just a portfolio—it’s a full platform designed to grow from MVP to a **multi-service DevOps startup**.
